<h2>About Me</h2>

<img src="assets/images/selfie.jpg" alt="self portrait">


<p>Hello My name is Gaby, I have a Bachelor's of Science in Radio and Television Communications from Texas A&M Univeristy - Commerce. I've been working in the radio field since about 2010 where I started as an on-air producer for a local radio station. <br>
    By 2012 my radio career transitioned to the corporate side when I was hired by Cumulus Media Networks to work in their traffic department working with sales, national on-air talent, and scripts from nationwide companies.  Currently I am still involved with radio ads, by trafficking copy to radio stations via data entry on a platform that generates logs for all the radio stations on the network nation wide. 
</p>
<p>My web development experience starts with generic copy and pasting HTML layouts for my myspace page back in the 2000's. Lately I have become more familiarized with coding web pages as I plan to transition careers. I have taken community college classes at Collin College in Plano, TX. And now I am currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp at Southern Methodist Univeristy. </p>
